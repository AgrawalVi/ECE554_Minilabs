created github repo with vscode build in integration.

the snapshot of the simulation log and waveform can be found in screenshots/ip_simulation and screenshots/our_simulation respectively. 

the simulation log shows that the macout value is 1B58 which is correct, and it is what was seen on our FPGA during the lab.

The resource usage is as follows:

ours: 110
ip: 85

This makes sense because real professionals are writing the IPs and I'd really hope that they can do a better job than we can. We also used 2 modulos that were not necessary in our FIFO design, which could contribute to the increase in resource usage.
