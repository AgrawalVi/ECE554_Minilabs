I verified the design by running our custom testbench, where we instantiated the matrix multiplier along with the memory component and 
the Avalon loader. After executing the testbench, we observed that the outcomes were correct.

To address timing issues, we introduced additional pipeline registers in both the MAC and Avalon loader sections 
of the design, which allowed us to meet our timing requirements.

The design was also tested on the FPGA hardware, and it operated as expected; a picture of this is included in the screenshots directory.

During SignalTap debugging, we configured a trigger on the 'readdatavalid' signal and monitored 'readdata' as it became valid,
confirming the outputs matched our expectations.

Implementing adequate pipelining was challenging. We went through multiple iterations to improve the
maximum achievable clock frequency (fmax). Initially, the design could only run as high as 150 MHz 
in the worst case, but after careful optimization and the addition of pipelines, we were able to exceed 200 MHz.
