I tested the design via the testbench that we created. We instantiated the matrix multiplier, the memory, and the avalon loader. 
We then ran the testbench and checked the results, which were correct. A snapshot of the waveforms can be found in the screenshots folder.

We fixed the design to meet the timing constraints by adding pipeline registers to the mac and avalon loader. 

We tested the design on the FPGA and it worked correctly. A photo is in the screenshots folder.

For signaltap, we set a trigger on the readdatavalid signal and checked readdata when that went high. We validated the data to be correct.

We had a lot of difficulties with pipelining the design. We had to make a lot of iterations to get our fmax to get above 200Mhz in the worst case. 
We were at 150Mhz in the worst case and we were able to get it above 200Mhz by adding pipelining 

Another thign we had in our FIFO before was a modulus, which is completely unnecessary and we removed it. This also helped get our fmax up
and also reduced our resource usage since we're not just using standard overflow to manage the tail and head of the cirular buffer in the fifo.
